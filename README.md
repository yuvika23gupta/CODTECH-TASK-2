**Overview of the project

***PROJECT: 
***OBJECTIVE:  CODE AND TESTBENCH FOR FINITE STATE MACHINE
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and verify the functionality of a finite state machine (FSM) using Verilog HDL. This includes creating a testbench to simulate and validate its correct operation, ensuring a solid understanding of state-based digital design and hardware description languages.


***Key Activities
